# Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version information:
#
#   * Start with version information of ‘0:0:0’ for each libtool library.
#
#   * Update the version information only immediately before a public
#     release of your software.  More frequent updates are
#     unnecessary, and only guarantee that the current interface
#     number gets larger faster.
#
#   * If the library source code has changed at all since the last
#     update, then increment revision (‘c:r:a’ becomes ‘c:r+1:a’).
#
#   * If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
#     last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.
#
#   * If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
#     then increment age.
#
#   * If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last
#     public release, then set age to 0.
