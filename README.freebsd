Introduction
============

This file describes the steps required to build this bundle on a supported
FreeBSD system.  See README for more information about the tested
configurations.

The kqueue-based monitor should be compatible with any *BSD release with support
for kqueue.  So far, however, the author has only tested this release on FreeBSD
v. >= 10.0.  Feedback on different *BSD systems is much appreciated and will
benefit other users as well.

Installation
============

See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure and install
fswatch.

fswatch is a C++ program and a C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard is
required to compile it.  FreeBSD v. >= 10.0 ships by default with the CLang
compiler suite which builds this package correctly.  It can also be built with
GCC installed from the package collection or ports tree.

The configure script enforces an ordered compiler search list and clang++ will
be used first if available.  If you do not like this choice and wish to use
another compiler set the value of the CXX environment variable to the name of
your compiler binary.  If, for example, you wish to use the g++ compiler, then
use this command to configure the build:

    $ ./configure CXX=g++
