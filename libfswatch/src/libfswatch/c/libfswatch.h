  /**
   * The `libfswatch` C API let users create monitor sessions and receive file
   * system events matching the specified criteria.  Most API functions return
   * a status code of type FSW_STATUS which can take any value specified in
   * the error.h header.  A successful API call returns FSW_OK and the last
   * error can be obtained calling the fsw_last_error() function.
   *
   * If the compiler and the C++ library used to build `libfswatch` support the
   * thread_local storage specified then this API is thread safe and a
   * different state is maintained on a per-thread basis.
   *
   * Session-modifying API calls (such as fsw_add_path) will take effect the
   * next time a monitor is started with fsw_start_monitor.
   *
   * Currently not all monitors supports being stopped, in which case
   * fsw_start_monitor is a non-returning API call.
   *
   * A basic session needs at least:
   *
   *   * A path to watch.
   *   * A callback to process the events sent by the monitor.
   *
   * as shown in the next example (error checking code was omitted).
   *
   *     // Use the default monitor.
   *     const FSW_HANDLE handle = fsw_init_session(system_default_monitor_type);
   *
   *     fsw_add_path(handle, "my/path");
   *     fsw_set_callback(handle, my_callback);
   *
   *     fsw_start_monitor(handle);
   *
   * A suitable callback function is a function pointer of type
   * FSW_CEVENT_CALLBACK, that is it is a function conforming with the
   * following signature:
   *
   *     void c_process_events(fsw_cevent const * const events,
   *                           const unsigned int event_num,
   *                           void * data);
   *
   * When a monitor receives change events satisfying all the session criteria,
   * the callback is invoked and passed a copy of the events.
   */
