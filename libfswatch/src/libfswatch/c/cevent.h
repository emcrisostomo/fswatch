/**
 * @brief Backend-agnostic change flags.
 *
 * Each element of this enum represents a backend-agnostic change flag.  No
 * direct mapping to backend-specific change types is guaranteed to exist: a
 * change type may be mapped to multiple `fsw_event_flag` instances included
 * the `PlatformSpecific` flag.
 *
 * The values of event flags are all powers of 2, that is numbers @f$f=2^n@f$
 * where @f$n@f$ is an integer.  This representation makes it easy to combine
 * flags into a bit mask and encode multiple events flags into a single integer.
 *
 * A monitor implementation is required to map implementation-specific flags
 * into API flags.  Sometimes, though, a perfect match is not possible and the
 * following situation may arise:
 *
 *   - One platform-specific flag must be mapped into multiple API flags.
 *
 *   - Multiple platform-specific flags must be mapped into a single API flag.
 *
 *   - A mapping is not possible for some flags, in which case they should be
 *     mapped to fsw_event_flag::PlatformSpecific.  The API currently offers no
 *     way to retain a platform-specific event flag value in this case.
