     *
     * If you specify this flag and more than latency seconds have elapsed since
     * the last event, your app will receive the event immediately.  The
     * delivery of the event resets the latency timer and any further events
     * will be delivered after latency seconds have elapsed.  This flag is
     * useful for apps that are interactive and want to react immediately to
     * changes but avoid getting swamped by notifications when changes are
     * occurring in rapid succession.  If you do not specify this flag, then
     * when an event occurs after a period of no events, the latency timer is
     * started. Any events that occur during the next latency seconds will be
     * delivered as one group (including that first event).  The delivery of the
     * group of events resets the latency timer and any further events will be
     * delivered after latency seconds.  This is the default behavior and is
     * more appropriate for background, daemon or batch processing apps.
