   * A path filter is a regular expression used to accept or reject file change
   * events based on the value of their path.  A filter has the following
   * characteristics:
   *
   *   - It has a _regular expression_ (monitor_filter::text), used to match the
   *     paths.
   *
   *   - It can be an _inclusion_ or an _exclusion_ filter
   *     (monitor_filter::type).
   *
   *   - It can be case _sensitive_ or _insensitive_
   *     (monitor_filter::case_sensitive).
   *
   *   - It can be an _extended_ regular expression (monitor_filter::extended).
   *
   * Further information about how filtering works in `libfswatch` can be found
   * in @ref path-filtering.
