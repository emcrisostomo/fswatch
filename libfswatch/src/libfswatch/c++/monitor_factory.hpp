  /**
   * @brief Object factory class for fsw::monitor instances.
   *
   * Since multiple monitor implementations exist and the caller potentially
   * ignores which monitors will be available at run time, there must exist a
   * way to query the API for the list of available monitor and request a
   * particular instance.  The fsw::monitor_factory is an object factory class
   * that provides basic monitor _registration_ and _discovery_ functionality:
   * API clients can query the monitor registry to get a list of available
   * monitors and get an instance of a monitor either by _type_ or by _name_.
   *
   * In order for monitor types to be visible to the factory they have to be
   * _registered_.  Currently, monitor implementations are registered at compile
   * time.
   *
   * The same monitor type cannot be used to register multiple monitor
   * implementations.  No checks are in place to detect this situation and the
   * registration will succeed; however, the registration process of multiple
   * monitor implementations for the same monitor type is _not_ deterministic.
