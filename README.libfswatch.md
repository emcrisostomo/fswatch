README
======

`libfswatch` is a library that provides developers the functionality of
`fswatch`, the main `libfswatch` frontend.  The library provides both C and C++
bindings.

`libfswatch` provides the following [documentation]:

  * Texinfo documentation, included with the distribution.
  * HTML documentation.
  * PDF documentation.
  * A [wiki] page.
  * A man page.

`libfswatch` official documentation is provided in Texinfo format.  This is the
most comprehensive source of information about `libfswatch` and the only
authoritative one.  The man page, in particular, is a stub that suggests the
user to use the info page instead.

If you are installing `libfswatch` using a package manager and you would like
the PDF manual to be bundled into the package, please send a feature request to
the package maintainer.
